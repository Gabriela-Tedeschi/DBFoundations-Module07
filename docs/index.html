##Introduction
In this document, I will define UDFs and the purpose they serve. I will also explain the differences between Scalar, Inline Table, and Multi-Statement Tables Functions, outlining how to create these different forms of UDFs and when they each are useful.

###1. Explain when you would use a SQL UDF.
You create and use SQL User Defined Functions (UDFs) when you want to simplify the process of performing certain operations, but donâ€™t have built-in functions that will accomplish this. You may use a UDF in the place of a complex or frequently used Select statement to make accessing its results set easier for reporting purposes. UDFs can be Scalar Functions, Inline Table Functions, and Multi-Statement Functions, meaning you can return a single value, add a new column to a results set by performing calculations for each row, or return a table of values.
